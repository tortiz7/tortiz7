<h2> Hey there! I'm Triston Ortiz 👨🏻‍💻</h2>

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

I'm an **IT Engineer** with a passion for building scalable, automated, and resilient infrastructure.

With over five years of hands-on experience in systems administration and IT operations, I've recently supercharged my skill set with an intensive focus on **Cloud Engineering and AI** through the Kura Labs program. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's engineering a secure patching strategy for hundreds of devices or building a deep learning model to analyze medical images.

My unique background as an **English major from Wesleyan University** gives me a distinct advantage: I don't just solve technical challenges; I communicate them clearly, write comprehensive documentation, and bridge the gap between complex engineering concepts and business needs.

When I'm not working with technology, you can find me hiking with my dog, exploring new music, or getting lost in a great film.
